Android Architecture Patterns
========

The Android framework offers a lot of flexibility when it comes to defining how to organize and architect an Android app. This freedom, whilst very valuable, can also result in apps with large classes, inconsistent naming and architectures (or lack of) that can make testing, maintaining and extending difficult.

In this project I will present the same application (a weather forecasting service) implemented using different architectural concepts and tools.

This project can be used for reference or as a starting point for creating your own apps. The focus here is on code structure, architecture, testing and maintainability. However, bear in mind that there are many ways to build apps with these architectures and tools, depending on your priorities, so these shouldn't be considered canonical examples. The UI is deliberately kept simple.
